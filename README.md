# Sales_performance_-SQL-Power_BI-
Analyzed multi-year sales data using SQL and Power BI to track revenue, profit, and growth trends. Built interactive dashboards with DAX measures to identify top products, regions, and sales reps, enabling data-driven business decisions. Applied advanced SQL techniques (CTEs, window functions, ranking, growth analysis) to uncover sales trends, performance gaps, and profitability insights.

# Business Objective
* How are sales, revenue, and profit trending over time?
* Which products, regions, and sales reps drive performance?
* Where are leakages (low profit, declining sales)?
* How can management optimize strategy?
* How does cumulative revenue build over time?
* Which products perform best within each region?
* Which sales reps perform above or below regional average?

# Dataset
I have worked on an e-commerce sales dataset that I downloaded from Kaggle. It has coulmns as order_id, order_date, customer_id, product, region, sales_rep, quantity, sales_amount and cost. 

# Steps taken
* Imported data into MySQL and Power BI.
* Wrote complex SQL queries for KPI calculation, trend analysis, and performance benchmarking
* Created DAX measures for MoM growth, AOV, and profit margin analysis
* Built interactive Power BI dashboards with sales, profit, margin, and growth metrics
* Identified top & bottom-performing products, regions, and sales reps
* Delivered actionable insights to improve sales strategy and profitability

# SQL Queries, Power BI DAX calculation and Final Insights

I have created a Power point presentation that I have uploaded in Github itself, Kindly chcek it out.

The sales data shows a stable, well-diversified business with ₹470M+ in revenue and a healthy 23% margin. East and West regions lead performance, while wearables and electronics dominate top selling products. Although margins are consistent, a few high volume products like keyboards and smartphones show slightly lower profitability, presenting margin optimization opportunities. Sales rep performance is evenly distributed, indicating strong team consistency rather than dependency on a single high performer.
